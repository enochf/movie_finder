## Movie Finder (in development)

The following project is currently in development. Movie Finder is an app, developed in Vue 3, designed to act as a virtual Dewey Decimal System for my personal DVD collection. I have several large binders where the physical DVD's are stored and we often need them for roadtrips with the family. The app connects to my Plex server API at home and pulls a list of all of our movies and then allows me to organize them in Binders and Pages in order to find them more quickly. The additional location data is stored in Firebase Firestore service.
